# Machine-Learning-Implementations
My Solutions for the Coursera Machine Learning Course offered by Stanford University and instructed by Andrew Ng. Uploaded here to showcase skills and help students. Some skeleton code was provided by course instrutors. If you are a student please do not just copy and paste code to ace assignments. It is a violation of the Academic Honesty policy and will hinder any actual learning.

## ex1
An implementation of the linear regression learning algorithm.
## ex2
